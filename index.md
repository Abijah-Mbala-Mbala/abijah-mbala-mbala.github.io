## Overview

AuthSystem is a secure authentication system built using Node.js. It leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and supports email and text verification. With Cloudinary integration, it allows users to upload and manage images efficiently. The system is designed for scalability and safety, using MongoDB as the backend database.

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Abijah-Mbala-Mbala/AuthSystem/releases).

## Installation

To get started with AuthSystem, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abijah-Mbala-Mbala/AuthSystem.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd AuthSystem
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service
   EMAIL_USER=your_email_user
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
   CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or curl. Below are some examples of how to use the API endpoints.

### User Registration

To register a new user, send a POST request to `/api/auth/register` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "username": "exampleUser",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

### User Login

To log in, send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "yourpassword"
}
```

### Email Verification

After registration, users will receive an email with a verification link. Clicking the link will send a GET request to `/api/auth/verify/:token` to verify the email.

### Text Verification

To send a text verification code, call the endpoint `/api/auth/send-verification-code` after logging in. The user will receive a code via SMS.
